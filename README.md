# Activity_Recognition
Classification the below activities based on Naive Bayes Classifier:

**sitting, standing, walking, downstairs, upstairs, typing, reading, hand_wash, dishes,vacuum**

The project includes:
* importing the data and the important python modules.
* Dealing with missed NaN values, by replacing them with the mean.
* Visualizing the data for each activity.
* Data segmentation & Feature extraction.
* Splitting the dataset into training and testing.
* 10-fold cross-validation.
* Applying machine learning algorithm.
* Applying tool chain to investigate different parameters affect the accuracy of Naive Bays Classifier.
* Displaying the accuracy of the model.
